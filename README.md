## [Description](#description)

In this homework, I builded the back end of an e-comerce site. I use express, sequelize and MySQL database. 

The program has three API routes, Categories, Products, and Tags. The data of each of this routes is displayed in a formated json. Each API routes has a API GET, POST, PUT and DELETE route to display, create, update, and delete the data of the database. The database has 4 models for each area, Categories, Products, Tags and ProducTags.
